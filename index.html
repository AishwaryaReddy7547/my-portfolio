      <p id="para2">When I was in my 2nd year Btech in JNTUA college of Engineering I realised how much I had left to learn.That made me to decide the domain that I'm interested in.The traditional style of Education didn't give me any ripen fruit that made me think out of bounds.I decided  to choose the domain that I am interested in and that resulted in Web Development.When I was in my 3rd year I passionate about Computer Networks that encouraged myself to opt Ethical Hacking as my second domain.</p>

      <h3 id="head4">My Web Trek</h3>
      <p id="para3">Visualization effect that we get while doing something is the first reason for choosing this domain.It was all started with HTML and CSS soon I have learned Javascript.Going into depth as a web developer made me more focused and creative.I did 2 major like Women Empowerment Webiste and Ecommerce Webiste in elation.This gave me confidence to try for the Nanodegree program in Web Design organized by Udacity.I have even completed my first Web Design internship in InternshipStudio and now I am working as Intern at Oasis Infobyte.I have Even started working on React.</p>
